        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup almond flour, finely ground</li>
            <li>1 Confectioners Sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 Egg whites, room temperature</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon clear vanilla</li>
            <li>2-3 Drops blue good gel dye</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        FILLING INGREDIENTS:

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 Cup (1 Stick) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1-1/2 Cups Confectioners sugar</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon clear vanilla</li>
            <li>1 Drop blue food gel dye</li>
            <li>2/3 Cup raspberry jam</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        STEPS:
        <ol>
            <li>Into a medium bowl, sift the almond flour and confectioners sugar, twice. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, whisk the egg whites for 2 to 3 minutes, until foamy.</li>
            <li>Slowly whisk in the granulated sugar, until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Stir in the vanilla and food coloring.</li>
            <li>Fold in 1/3 of the dry ingredients, until just combined.</li>
            <li>Continue with another 1/3, followed by the rest, until the batter falls into ribbons and you can make a "figure 8".</li>
            <li>Transfer the macaron batter into a piping bag with a round tip.</li>
            <li>Prep baking sheets with parchment.</li>
            <li>Pipe the macarons onto the parchment into small 1-inch circles, spacing them 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Tap the baking sheet firmly onto a flat surface a few times to release air bubbles. Let the macarons sit at room temperature for 40 mins, until dry to the touch.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until they rise and the "feet" have formed. Transfer to a wire rack, let cool completely.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl with a handheld mixer, mix the butter and confectioners sugar.</li>
            <li>Add the heavy cream, vanilla, and food gel dye.</li>
            <li>Transfer the buttercream to a piping bag. Onto the flat side of one macaron shell, pipe a circle of buttercream.</li>
            <li>Add a small spoonful of jam into the center. Top it with a second macaron shell to sandwich.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining macaron shells and filling, to serve.</li>
        </ol>
